        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Shivam Tiwari, a product management professional at Paytm Travel, dedicated to crafting exceptional user experiences through innovative product solutions. With a keen eye for problem-solving and a natural flair for innovation, I specialize in curating strategic product roadmaps that lead to success. My approach harmonizes data-driven insights with creative thinking, ensuring that every product decision is both informed and impactful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hold an MBA from the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta and a Bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi. My academic background has equipped me with a strong foundation in both technical and managerial domains, enabling me to bridge the gap between complex technological solutions and user-centric design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Prior to joining Paytm, I contributed to product initiatives at WinZO, where I honed my skills in user engagement and gamification strategies. My diverse experience across different sectors has provided me with a holistic perspective on product development and management.
