        <h2>🚨 Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Many users hesitate to book bus tickets due to unreliable operators, poor cancellation policies, and inconsistent service quality. This led to **lower trust and higher drop-offs** in the booking funnel.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="solution">
        <h2>💡 Solution & Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            We introduced **Paytm Assured for Buses**, a verification program that ensures:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ **Only trusted operators** with high service ratings</li>
            <li>✅ **Guaranteed refunds** for cancellations</li>
            <li>✅ **Better on-time performance & clean buses**</li>
            <li>✅ **Priority customer support** for assured bookings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The **Assured tag** was displayed prominently on eligible buses, and a **new filtering system** allowed users to book only Paytm Assured buses.
